This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

This project can be exported as a static site and hosted using GitHub Pages:

```bash
npm run export
```

The command above builds the site and outputs the static files to the `docs` directory. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings and select the `docs` folder as the source.

Refer to the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) for more details on static exports.
